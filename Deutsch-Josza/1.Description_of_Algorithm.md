<h1> Deutsch-Josza Algorithm </h1>

<h3>Problem</h3>
  
Consider being given some hidden Boolean function __*f*__ where __*f(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>)*__ maps each __*x<sub>i</sub>*__ to __*0 or 1*__. </br></br>
The function is, however, known to be either balanced or constant. This implies that the function __*f*__ only returns a specific value (it could be only __1__ or only __0__) or it returns exactly half of all the answers as __0__ and exactly half of the other answers as __1__.
</br>
</br>
We are asked to determine whether __*f*__ is balanced or constant.

<h3>Classical Solution</h3>

The solution may be found in the best case by evaluating __*f*__ with different values twice. If the two answers are not the same we know that __*f*__ is balanced.

In the worst case we wil need to evaluate __*f*__ a total of __*2 <sup>n</sup> + 1*__ times to ensure it is constant.

<h3>Quantum Solution</h3>

The solution to this problem may found with only __*1*__ iteration using a quantum computer.

__The Algorithm__

1. Setup __*n + 1*__ qubit registers where __*n*__ is the number of inputs initialised to __|0>__.
2. Apply a Hadamard Gate over every qubit register.
