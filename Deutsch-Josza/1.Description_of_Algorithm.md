<h3>Problem</h3>
  
Consider being given some hidden Boolean function __*f*__ where __*f(x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>) &#8594; 0 or 1*__
The function is, however, known to be either balanced or constant. This implies that the function __*f*__ only returns a specific value (it could be only __1__ or only __0__) or it returns exactly half of all the answers as __0__ and exactly half of the other answers as __1__.
