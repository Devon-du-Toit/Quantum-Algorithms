<h1> Grover's Algorithm </h1>

</br></br>

<h2>Problem</h2>
  
Consider a large list of __*N*__ items. Within the list is a single element (__*w*__) that we wish to locate. 

</br></br>

<h2>Classical Solution</h2>

We could find the element by going one-by-one through each element within the list. We would need to search through __*N/2*__ elements on average to locate our specific element. In the worst case we would need to do __*N*__ searches.

</br></br>

<h2>Quantum Solution</h2>

On a Quantum Computer we can find the element within __&#8730; &#x305;N&#x305;__ searches by employing Grover's amplitude aplification technique.
